    <p>A couple days ago it finally dawned on me that I hadn&rsquo;t tested the power supply inside the <a href="/armdroid/page/images/conveyor.html">conveyor belt</a> that came with the Armdroid. So I plugged everything together and turned it on.</p>
<p>The motor started making a &ldquo;d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d&rdquo; sound like it was trying to move, and when I (carefully!) removed the cover with the motor on, I could see that it was indeed trying to move, but something was wrong and it was jumping backwards every cycle. I didn&rsquo;t really know what was going on, but unfortunately the bell rang at the end of lunch and I had to go to fifth period.</p>
<p>Today I pulled the little circuit board off the plastic standoffs it was attached to and had a look at it. Back when I opened the front cover to get the pictures of it, the heatsunk chip popped out of its socket, and so I absentmindedly smushed it back in. It turns out that one of its pins had missed the hole in the socket when I had done that and was not connected, hence the missing step in the driver cycle. And the out-of-place pin was hiding between the socket and the stepper motor&rsquo;s plug next to it, where I could not see without taking the board out. Sneaky sneaky.</p>
<p>After fixing the chip&rsquo;s pin, the motor ran just fine. On &ldquo;high&rdquo; it ran about 60 RPM (and with 200 steps per revolution, that&rsquo;s 200 Hz for the clock if each step takes one oscillation of the clock), on &ldquo;medium&rdquo; it ran about 40 RPM, and &ldquo;low&rdquo; was 20 RPM (3 seconds per revolution).</p>
<p>Pulling the board out of its enclosure also allowed me to get a look at the chips on it. And it turns out my hunch was right &ndash; the small 8-pin chip was indeed a 555 timer, the heatsunk chip was the same ULN2003A quad Darlington switch used in the Armdroid itself, and the third one is a 74LS175 quad D flip-flop that I assume is wired into itself to turn the pulses from the 555 into quadrature control signals for the motor. I updated the conveyor&rsquo;s page on the Armdroid website to actually list these part numbers instead of just my hunch.</p>
<p>See how much you can learn when you <em>actually look at stuff closely</em>? That&rsquo;s a lesson that I really need to learn.</p>
