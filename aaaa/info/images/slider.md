Title: Screw Slider Pictures
Status: hidden

The slider track accessory was new because I could not find any documents online that mentioned it.

There's not much to it either way. It's a square platform that slides on two rails and is controlled by a stepper motor.

    %: There's about 415 mm of travel in the slider mechanism.

The motor end has a small pulley on the screw and a large pulley on the motor, to make it go faster, at the expense of precision. You can also see the female GX-16 connector that plugs into the accessory motor port on the Armdroid.
