Title: Disassembled!
Date: 2022-10-20

Today I finished disassembling the broken Armdroid. It is now a pile of pieces, and boy, are there a lot of them!

(The close observer may notice the base is missing. I forgot about that because I had taken it off earlier to test the motors and reverse engineer the circuit board. Oops!)

Additionally, I made some more progress trying to get the Armdroid to actually work. The two-pin GX16 connector doesn't have a matching power cord anywhere I would know of, so I pulled it off from the power wire and replaced it with a two-terminal Anderson connector, leftover ffrom my school's now-defunct FTC team.

The FTC team left behind a bunch of 12 volt, 3000 mAh batteries, plus chargers, that I am pretty sure would be more than sufficient to power the Armdroid. We'll see if they work.
