# Armdroid site

This is intended to be a central place for resources, documents, and code pertaining to the Armdroid 1000 made by D&M Computing in the 1990s.

Head over to <https://dragoncoder047.github.io/armdroid/> to see the nicely formatted files. (I use a couple of Python Markdown extensions here that are not compatible with Github Flavored Markdown so the Github preview will be a mess.)
